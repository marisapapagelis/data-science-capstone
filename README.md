# The Impact of Covid-19 on Travel

## Project Description
I found it both relevant and of interest to look into the potential effects Covid-19 had on travel trends, and how these trends differ based on sociodemographic factors. This project focuses on answering a research question surrounding how Covid-19 impacted weekly travel trends within Chicago, Washington DC, Dallas, and Seattle using stepwise model selection on a binary logistic regression model.
